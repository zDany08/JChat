## JChat
JChat is a simple chat application built with **Java**, using sockets to communicate between server and clients.

### How to run Client
Execute jar file by double-clicking on it, or with command prompt using the following command:
```
java -jar Client.jar
```

### How to run Server
Run jar file via command prompt with the following command:
```
java -jar Server.jar 50010
```
50010 is default port, you can change it to the one you need.
> _If any issues occur, I recommend you to run the client with command prompt and check for warning/error messages._
